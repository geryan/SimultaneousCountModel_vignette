# SimultaneousCountModel_vignette

This repository contains a vignette illustrating the "simultaneous count model" approach from [*Simultaneous‐count models to estimate abundance from counts of unmarked individuals with imperfect detection*, Conservation Biology 33(3) 697—708, G.E. Ryan et al. 2019.]( https://doi.org/10.1111/cobi.13261)

The vignette is contained in the R-markdown file [scm_vignette.Rmd](https://github.com/geryan/SimultaneousCountModel_vignette/blob/master/scm_vignette.Rmd), and you can run through the code yourself using this script. You must use RStudio.

Rendered [html](https://github.com/geryan/SimultaneousCountModel_vignette/blob/master/simultaneous_count_model_vignette.html) and [pdf](https://github.com/geryan/SimultaneousCountModel_vignette/blob/master/simultaneous_count_model_vignette.pdf) versions are also available so you can see what those results should look like. These are best downloaded to be viewed. You might not be able to knit the Rmd file successfully because the large amout of JAGS output while the model is fitting seems to cause `knitr` it to freeze, so you may not be able to successfully recreate these rendered files from your Rmd.
